This is the basic skeleton of how our project UI looks like.
Ideally, we will be using Single Page Application Frameworks or libraries like React or Angular for our UI
The main Components of our UI will be -
1.Register Route - Here we will take details from the user and on submitting the form, we will do a post request to our api and
redirect user to login page.
2.Login Route - Here we will take username and password from the user and do a post request to our api, and upon success we will get
a jwt token in the response and we will redirect user to home page  . we will store this token in cookies and later use it in
Authorization headers of our requests.
3.Home Route - Here we will have a form where user will fill the details to book a ticket and on clicking search button, we will 
redirect user to Booking Page.
4.Booking Route - Here we will display the trains that we got upon search and their seat availability and other information.On selecting
available train and clicking on button, we will redirect user to payment page with booking information and payment methods.
5.Payment Route - Here user will select his payment mode and proceed further.
6.Account Route - Here we will display user details and we will give option to edit those details.
NavBar will be common across all the Routes.
Ideally we should implement a Protected Route Mechanism that prevents unauthenticated users from accessing major routes of the application.
Here the data for the Routes will be dynamic and  coming from api requests.

I have just wrote the basic HTML and CSS for Register , Login and Home Pages which are basic forms.
